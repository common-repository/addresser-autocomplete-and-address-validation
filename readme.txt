== Description ==

Addresser plugin for Wordpress & Woocommerce provides address lookup capabilities to your Wordpress websites to improve data quality of shipping and billing addresses of your online store. 

The plugin uses our custom predictive suggestion algorithms that auto-completes your customer address as they start typing the address. 

The pre-emptive nature of address autocomplete means you can be rest assured that selected address aids in maintaining your customer data quality at the highest level possible, and significantly reducing the returned deliveries/mail.

Addresser plugin uses paid API subscription provided by Addresser (Extropy Systems Pty Ltd.). Visit www.addresser.com.au for pricing.

Leave the tedious tasks of sourcing and maintaining data from the most authoritative sources such as Australia Post and Australian Federal Government.
